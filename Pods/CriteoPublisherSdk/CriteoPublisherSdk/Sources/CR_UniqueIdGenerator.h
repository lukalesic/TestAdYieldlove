/**
 * Generate a new unique ID suitable for Criteo backends
 *
 * The output represents a 32 bytes unique ID formatted into hexadecimal. The 8
 * first (MSB) bytes represent the UNIX timestamp in seconds. The 24 following
 * ones are random from a cryptographic random generator. This ensures keeping a
 * very low probability of collision. At SDK level, a simpler random [NSUUID
 * UUID] would be sufficient. But those ids are expected to be sent to a Criteo
 * backend and should then be (almost) unique at Criteo level and scale with it.
 *
 * This is based on an algorithm already done in C#, Scala and Java to generate
 * impression id. Generation IDs are suitable for Impression IDs
 *
 * @see Publisher SDK Android version has a similar implementation
 * @see CDB ImpressionIdHelper: https://go.crto.in/publisher-sdk-cdb-impressionidhelper
 * @see Arbitrage ArtbitrageId: https://go.crto.in/publisher-sdk-arbitrage-arbitrageid
 *
 * @return a new ID
